//! A [blake3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)#BLAKE3)-based
//! merkle (hash) tree implementation for superfast trees âš¡
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use irkle::Tree;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     println!("{:#?}", Tree::new(vec!["hello", "there"]));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! Simply add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [depedencies]
//! irkle = "0.1"
//! ```
//!
//! ## Current status
//!
//! Creation and verification of merkle trees have been implemented and are fast,
//! but could be greatly improved with the help of parralisation as currently this
//! library is single-threaded.
//!
//! This is the tracking issue for the multi-threading of irkle:
//! [`https://github.com/Owez/irkle/issues/1`](https://github.com/Owez/irkle/issues/1)
